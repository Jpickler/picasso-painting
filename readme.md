--things I've done throughout this project:

--HTML
  -- set up containers
    --picture
      --frame
        --shapes
  --created a form and put it in the footer

--CSS

-- set the medias for the different screens
-- had to put the triangles (trees) into the medias because i could not make the triangles based on a percentage of the container. this was my solution, but would rather have it be more dynamic.
--put the form at the bottom as a footer and fixed it to the bottom of the viewport
--painting 
  -- added padding-top: 1% so that the frame (container) would stay at the top of the viewport


--frame
  --this is the container for the art
  -- sets the container for flexbox and formats the contents to be in a row from the left, and aligned to the top
  -- padding:100% this makes the container a proportional square

--all elements
  -- width, height, top, and left are all percentages so that the shapes change size with the frame, but stay in the same position. this way, the art (picture) looks the same at all medias

  --sun
    -- makes a circle
    -- set z-index to 1 so that it is in front of the frame

  --tree
    -- makes a triangle

  --cabin
    -- makes a square
